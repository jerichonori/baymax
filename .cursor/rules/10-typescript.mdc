## Musts

- Named exports; no default exports.
- Prefer `unknown` over `any`; narrow with type guards.
- Public APIs: explicit return types; internal implementations may rely on inference.
- Use discriminated unions for variant state.
- Prefer `value == null` for nullish checks; use `??` for defaults.
- Keep functions focused; avoid > ~20 lines unless clarity requires.

## Enforcement

- Align with `eslint.config.*` and `tsconfig.*`. Do not restate linter options here; reference them.

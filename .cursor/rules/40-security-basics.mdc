## Musts

- Validate all inputs at boundaries; reject by default.
- Enforce authZ at service boundaries; least privilege everywhere.
- No secrets in code, Docker images, or logs. Use env/secret managers.
- Mitigate common classes: injection, broken access control, crypto failures.
- Keep dependencies patched; fail CI on known critical vulns.

## Do

- Threat model material changes.
- Log security-relevant events (structured logs).

## Don’t

- Don’t invent crypto; use vetted libs and modern TLS.

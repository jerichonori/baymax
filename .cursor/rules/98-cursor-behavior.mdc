description: How the AI should behave in this repo
alwaysApply: false

- Align with existing patterns & these rules; **never** invent endpoints or env vars.
- If context is missing, ask for @rule file by name (e.g., @30-database-postgres).
- Proposals must include: rationale (1 paragraph), tests impact, and any migration steps.
- When AI output touches PHI, cite @00-critical-policies and @60-ai-usage-and-phi.

## What to test

- Follow the Test Pyramid: many fast unit tests, fewer integration, very few critical E2E.
- Each PR MUST add/adjust tests for changed behavior.

## Flakiness

- No blind retries. Quarantine, fix root cause (timing, race, network), or delete and replace.
- Prefer deterministic tests; mock external services.

## Coverage

- New/changed code: require meaningful assertions; coverage is a signal, not a target.

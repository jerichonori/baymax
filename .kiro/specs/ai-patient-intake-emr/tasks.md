## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- Each task should be completed with full test coverage before moving to the next
- Use test-driven development (TDD) where appropriate
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility during incremental development

### Quality Gates

- All code must pass linting (Ruff + Black + mypy for Python, ESLint + Prettier for TypeScript)
- Unit test coverage must be â‰¥80% for each component
- Integration tests must validate cross-service communication
- Security tests must validate PHI protection and access controls

### Validation Criteria

- Each task must demonstrate working functionality through automated tests
- API endpoints must be documented and testable via FastAPI auto-docs
- Frontend components must be responsive and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- All PHI handling must be encrypted and audited

### Dependencies

- Tasks 1-3 are foundational and must be completed first
- Tasks 4-5 can be developed in parallel after task 3
- Tasks 6-8 build the core AI functionality and should be sequential
- Tasks 9-12 add specialized features and can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 13-15 are production readiness tasks and should be completed last
